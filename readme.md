# Get Started - Dashboard Component in Blazor Server Application

This project demonstrates how you can incorporate a DevExpress Dashboard component into a [Blazor Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-5.0#blazor-server) application. Use it as a template when you need to create a similar web application.

The backend is an ASP.NET Core application that processes requests from the client. UI updates, event handling, and JavaScript calls are handled over a SignalR connection.
